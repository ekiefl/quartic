Solve Quartic equations (4th degree polynomials) in C and Haskell.
License: BSD.

(Also solves cubic, quadratic, and linear equations)

The two implementations are very close in their structure/design.
Naturally, the Haskell implementation is shorter.

The C implementation is specific to "double"s, that is, it works only for real numbers (not complex or other fields).
The Haskell implementation is generic and should work for finite fields too (I think).
